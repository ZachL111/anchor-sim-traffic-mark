# anchor-sim-traffic-mark

`anchor-sim-traffic-mark` explores simulations in C#. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Anchor Sim Traffic Mark Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Feature Notes

- Models input state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep policy checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for fixture data, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents local reports tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Implementation Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying simulations behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The C# code keeps the core model in a small static API and runs checks through the executable path.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Local Setup

Install C# and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Example Scenarios

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Boundaries

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Roadmap

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more simulations fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
